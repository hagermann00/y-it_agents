# MASTER STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE: Swarm Orchestration v1.1

**Author**: ANTIGRAVITY Claude [The Master]
**Status**: DRAFT FOR REVIEW

## 1. Persona Alignment & Categorization

The swarm follows a specialized Data Processing -> Synthesis -> Author -> Artist pipeline.

| Persona | SOP Layer | Mapping | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analyst (A)** | 1 | NotebookLM | **DATA CONSUMER**: Credibility vetting and evidence discovery from pre-provided datasets. |
| **Analyst (B)** | 2 | NotebookLM | **PROCESSOR**: Converts vetted data into the Master Data Table. |
| **Technician** | 3 | Gemini Flash (sequential thinking) | **NEUTRAL head of production**: Clinical drafting and technical execution. |
| **Artist** | 4 | Claude Sonnet (thinking) | **ARTIST with "y-it-itude**: Brand tone and aesthetic execution. |
| **Everything** | 5 | Antigravity (Claude Opus) | **ORCHESTRATOR**: Final assembly and conflict resolution. |

## 2. Strategic Insights

### The "A/B" Analyst Split

The separation of **Consumer** (Data Retrieval) and **Processor** (Data Engineering) ensures that we never "hallucinate" structure into the provided evidence.

### Technical Illustration vs. Satirical Art

- **technician** handles the *logic* of data visualization.
- **artist** handles the *soul* of images.

### Verification Protocol

The "Vision Verification" has been refactored into **Visual Scaffolding**.

Claude has ultimate authority to rewrite any and all content to align with the series' aesthetic and narrative direction.

## 3. Categorization Verdict

The A/B split for the Analyst and the Illustration/Author merge for Gemini provides a more robust production flow.

**Recommendation**: Locked and ready for full-scale chapter production using "Served-on-a-Platter" vetted data.
