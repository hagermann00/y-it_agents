# POD Visual Generation Plan

## Character Scenarios

1. **Chad (The Hustler)**:
   - "A precise cartoon illustration of Chad, an optimistic tech-bro, looking at his laptop screen labeled 'Etsy Dash' showing a profit of $0.02. His face is innocence incarnate, he is determined and smiling. Precise line work, muted flat colors."
2. **Tyler (The Guru)**:
   - "A precise cartoon illustration of Tyler, the weary guru in a green shirt, explaining a '1,200-design death march' strategy on a whiteboard. He looks exhausted but professional. Precise line work, editorial aesthetic."
3. **PosiBot (The AI Manifestation)**:
   - "A cute but slightly glitchy robot with a permanent digital grin, holding a giant 'PASSIVE INCOME' banner that is upside down. Precise line work, sleek dark mode backdrop."

## Execution Strategy

- Use `generate_image` tool with these refined prompts.
- Ensure all images follow the 'Gold Standard' visual style (Precise Cartoon).
- Save images directly to the artifacts directory for inclusion in the final walkthrough.
