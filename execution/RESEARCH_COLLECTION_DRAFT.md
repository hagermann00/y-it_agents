## SOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### Recommended Distribution (500 sources max)

| Category | Sources | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Deep Research Sessions** | 20-40 | Heavy lifting — each returns substantial data |
| **Official Platform Docs** | 30-50 | Pricing, policies, terms of service |
| **Course/Guru Sales Pages** | 20-30 | CLAIM collection |
| **Reddit Threads** | 50-80 | OUTCOME stories, failures, real talk |
| **YouTube Videos** | 30-50 | Tutorials, reviews, "I quit" videos |
| **News/Articles** | 30-50 | Industry data, trend reports |
| **Forum/Community Posts** | 40-60 | Raw testimonials, Q&A threads |
| **Government/Official Sources** | 10-20 | RESOURCE collection (SBA, SCORE, etc.) |
| **Case Studies/Receipts** | 20-30 | Verified OUTCOMES with evidence |
| **Buffer/Overflow** | 50-100 | Topic-specific additions |

**Total: ~300-500 sources depending on topic complexity**

## DEEP RESEARCH STRATEGY

### What to Use Deep Research For

Deep Research is NotebookLM's AI-powered comprehensive research tool. Each session counts as **1 source** but returns **extensive compiled data**.

**Best queries for Deep Research:**

```
CLAIMS:
→ "Income claims and promises from [TOPIC] courses and gurus"
→ "Marketing tactics used to sell [TOPIC] training programs"

MECHANICS:
→ "Complete step-by-step process to start [TOPIC] business"
→ "Technical requirements and tools needed for [TOPIC]"

COSTS:
→ "Full cost breakdown for starting [TOPIC] business in 2024"
→ "Hidden fees and unexpected expenses in [TOPIC]"

OUTCOMES:
→ "Success stories in [TOPIC] with verified income proof"
→ "Failure stories and why people quit [TOPIC]"
→ "Average earnings and income distribution in [TOPIC]"

CONSTRAINTS:
→ "Platform policies and restrictions affecting [TOPIC]"
→ "Common reasons [TOPIC] businesses fail or get banned"

RESOURCES:
→ "Free alternatives to paid [TOPIC] courses"
→ "Government and nonprofit resources for small business"
```

## SOURCE QUALITY TIERS

### Tier 1: STRONG (Prioritize)
```
✅ Official platform documentation
✅ Government/nonprofit sources
✅ Verified income proof with receipts
✅ Published financial reports
✅ Deep Research sessions (comprehensive)
```

### Tier 2: MEDIUM (Use with context)
```
☑️ Reddit posts with detail and coherence
☑️ YouTube videos from non-gurus
☑️ News articles from reputable outlets
☑️ Forum discussions with substantiation
```

### Tier 3: WEAK (Use sparingly, flag as weak)
```
⚠️ Anonymous claims without proof
⚠️ Social media flexes
⚠️ Guru testimonials (biased source)
⚠️ Older data (>2 years)
```

## SOURCE NAMING CONVENTION

When adding sources, use consistent naming:

```
[CLASSIFICATION]-[NUMBER]-[SHORT-DESCRIPTION]

Examples:
CLAIM-001-guru-income-promise
MECH-015-shopify-setup-tutorial
COST-032-facebook-ads-breakdown
OUTCOME-078-karen-failure-story
CONST-095-paypal-hold-policy
RSRC-112-score-free-mentoring
```

---

## RESEARCH PHASES

### Phase 1: Deep Research First (1-2 hours)
```
1. Run 20-30 Deep Research queries
2. Cover all 6 classifications
3. This gives you baseline coverage
4. ~20-30 source slots used, massive data collected
```

### Phase 2: Official Sources (1-2 hours)
```
1. Add all platform documentation
2. Add pricing pages (current, dated)
3. Add terms of service
4. Add payment processor policies
5. ~50-80 additional sources
```

3. Forum discussions
4. Facebook group screen captures
5. ~150-200 additional sources
```

### Phase 4: Gap Filling (1 hour)

2. Identify weak areas
3. Targeted source collection
4. Verify all 6 classifications represented
5. ~50-100 additional sources
```
