## CRITICAL INTEGRATION NOTES

### Data Table Authority
```
Y-It-itude Writer consumes THREE sources:
1. Mega neutral chapter (narrative draft)
2. DATA TABLE filtered by chapter ← ULTIMATE AUTHORITY
3. Y-IT Tone Document

RULE: If mega neutral text conflicts with data table, TABLE WINS.
See Y-IT_DATA_TABLE_SYSTEM_v1.md for full structure.
```

### Image Workflow
```
1. Y-It-itude Writer outputs TEXT ONLY
2. Claude Polish writes artistic image prompts
3. Images generated AFTER chapter text complete
4. Tech images: NotebookLM infographic (try first)
5. Artistic images: Execute Claude's prompts
```
