### Why They Won/Lost
*3-5 bullet points. Specific. Data-backed.*

```
LOSER EXAMPLE:
• Undercapitalized: Started with $1,000, needed $5,000 minimum
• Time-poor: 10 hrs/week when success requires 30+
• No ad experience: Burned $2,900 learning what experts know
• Wrong product: 34% return rate killed margins
• No exit criteria: Should have quit at $1,500 loss

WINNER EXAMPLE:
• Overcapitalized: $50K runway = could afford to fail repeatedly
• Time-rich: Quit job, went full-time immediately
• Existing skills: 3 years Facebook ads experience
• Network effect: Dad's business contacts = supplier relationships
• Exit criteria set: Would have quit at $20K loss (never hit)
```

## SECTION 6: THE ZINGER

*Every case ends with a memorable final line. This is what readers remember.*

### Zinger Templates

```
LOSER ZINGERS:
"Karen's not stupid. The marketing is just smarter."

"Jett went viral. His bank account didn't notice."

"Ron calculated his effective hourly rate and immediately 
applied to Costco. They said yes."

"Madison had 10,000 followers. Three of them bought something."

"Dave got fired for having a side hustle. The side hustle 
also fired him—it just took longer."

WINNER ZINGERS:
"Tyler succeeded. He also started on third base."

"Amy made $47,000 profit. She also aged 10 years in 18 months 
and her husband filed for divorce. Winning?"

NEUTRAL ZINGERS:
"The course was $497. The lesson was $3,223."

"He followed the steps exactly. The steps were wrong."
```

## TONE CALIBRATION

### For Losers
```
ENERGY: "Beautiful stubborn fool"
NOT: "What an idiot"

SHOW: Their logic made sense given the information they had
SHOW: The system is designed to extract money from them
SHOW: They're not alone—this is the median outcome

AVOID: Cruelty, mockery, "they deserved it" energy
```

### For Winners
```
ENERGY: "Yes, but..."
NOT: "Anyone can do this!"

SHOW: The specific advantages that made it possible
SHOW: The hidden costs (health, relationships, time)
SHOW: Why their success doesn't translate to reader

AVOID: Celebration, "just work harder" implications
```

## DATA TABLE INTEGRATION

Each case study must have a corresponding row in OUTCOMES table:

```csv
data_id,classification,chapter_destination,full_content,source,evidence_grade,archetype,label
DATA-078,OUTCOME,CH04,"[Full case narrative - 500+ words]",Reddit/Forum/Interview,STRONG,Side Hustler,LOSER
```

**RULE:** If it's not in the DATA TABLE, it doesn't go in the book.
