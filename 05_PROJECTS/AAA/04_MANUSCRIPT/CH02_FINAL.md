# CHAPTER 2: THE 10-STEP BLUEPRINT TO "EASY" STREET

Welcome to Step 2. If you’re still here, it means you’ve successfully survived Chapter 1 without realizing that a 98% profit margin is mathematically impossible for anyone who isn't a Colombian drug lord.

But don't worry about the math yet. We’re in Phase 1. This is the part where everything is easy, everyone is a winner, and the only thing standing between you and a Ferrari is a 10-step checklist that’s so simple a golden retriever could do it.

## Step 1: Find a "Winning" Niche

Gurus suggest local plumbers. Why plumbers? Because they’re traditionally bad at answering their phones and they have a lot of "leaking" money. See what we did there? Plumbers. Leaking. Get used to the puns; they’re the leading cause of death in AAA sales meetings.

## Step 2: Assemble the "God Stack"

This is the fun part where you sign up for software that you don't yet know how to use.

- **Voiceflow:** Think of it like Lego blocks for people who want to automate conversations. Just drag, drop, and boom—you have a chatbot.
- **Stack AI:** This is where the "brains" go. It connects your Lego blocks to an LLM so it can sound smart while it tells your plumber’s customers that he doesn’t work on Sundays.

## Step 3: The Digital "Knock on the Door"

The gurus say you should send 50 Instagram DMs a day. Just find a plumber, click 'Message', and say: *"Hey, I love your pipes. Would you like an AI to handle your appointments?"*

It’s foolproof. What could go wrong?

## Step 4–10: The Scaling Ritual

From here, the roadmap enters a state of pure magic. You set up a Stripe account (Step 4), connect the bot to the website (Step 6), and then simply hire a Virtual Assistant in the Philippines to handle the DMs while you "scale and automate" (Step 10).

The blueprints are clear. The tools are ready. The DMs are being sent.

"I can do this," thinks Chad.

And for about forty-eight hours, he’s absolutely right.
