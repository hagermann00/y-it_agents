# CHAPTER 2 NEUTRAL DRAFT: THE 10-STEP BLUEPRINT (AAA)

**Scope: The Roadmap**
**Topic: AI Automation Agency (AAA)**
**Authority: AAA_PRODUCTION_TABLE.csv**

## Objective

The execution of the AAA model follows a standardized 10-step sequence designed for rapid deployment.

## The Technical Execution

1. **Tool Selection:** The primary tool for building the conversational logic is Voiceflow, a visual interface for bot construction.
2. **Backend Integration:** For advanced Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, Stack AI is utilized to connect the frontend logic to robust backend APIs.
3. **Connectivity:** Zapier is designated as the primary orchestration tool to ensure that leads captured by the bot are automatically synced to the client's existing CRM systems.

## The Outreach Strategy

The blueprint emphasizes digital outreach. The standard method involves targeting localized industries (e.g., plumbing, HVAC) through Instagram Direct Messages (DMs). The goal is to send 50 high-volume messages per day to secure discovery calls.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Find Niche:** Identify a local industry with low digital automation.
2. **Build Demo:** Construct a sample bot in Voiceflow to show potential clients.
3. **Prospecting:** Source leads via Instagram or LinkedIn.
4. **The Approach:** Send DMs offering a "Free AI Audit."
5. **The Close:** Secure a $3,000/month retainer based on projected time savings.
6. **Integration:** Connect the bot to the client's website via a single line of code.
7. **Automation:** Use Stack AI to handle complex queries.
8. **Reporting:** Provide monthly data on "Leads qualified."
9. **Scaling:** Repeat the process with 10 identical clients.
10. **Automation of Agency:** Hire a virtual assistant (VA) to handle the DMs.
