# CHAPTER 7: THE PIVOT (OR: OTHER WAYS TO BUY GROCERIES)

So, you failed the Gauntlet. Or maybe you just realized that driving to a plumber’s shop in a polo shirt sounds like a special kind of hell.

That’s fine. You’re not a failure; you’re a survivor. And survivors know when to pivot before the ship hits the iceberg.

Let’s look at the "Opportunity Comparison" table. This is the one gurus hate because it uses something called "Perspective."

*A table comparing AAA ($3k+ cost, 90% failure) vs. A McDonald's job ($0 cost, 0% failure, immediate pay).*

It’s not as sexy as a Lamborghini, but a job at McDonald's has a 100% higher profit margin in the first week than an AI Agency. Think about that while you sip your McFlurry.

But if you still have that "beautiful stubborn fool" energy and you actually want to use the tech, there’s a better way: **Freelance Automation.**

Instead of trying to convince Mike the Plumber that he needs a $3,000 chatbot to talk to customers, just sell him a **Zapier** workflow that connects his website form to his phone.

- **Cost to you:** $0.
- **Hallucination risk:** 0%.
- **Value to Mike:** Infinite (because he actually gets the lead).

### ALTERNATIVE: THE ZAPIER WIZARD

**What it is:** You fix the "plumbing" of a business's data.
**Why it works:** Businesses already pay for these tools. They just don't know how to connect them.
**Realistic expectations:** $1,000 per project. No "God Stack" required.

You don't have to be a "Founder" to make money. Sometimes, being the person who actually makes the things work is enough.
