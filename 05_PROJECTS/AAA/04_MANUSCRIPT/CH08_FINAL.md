# CHAPTER 8: THE EXIT RAMP (OR: HOW TO SURVIVE THE HUSTLE)

Still here?

Fine. You beautiful stubborn fool. You’ve seen the "God Stack" explode, you’ve seen Karen’s silence, and you’ve seen the math that says you’re probably better off working at a drive-thru.

But you’re doing it anyway.

If you’re absolutely insisting on being the 2% that makes this work, we aren't here to stop you. We’re here to make sure you survive the attempt.

Before you spend another dime on a course or a Voiceflow subscription, you need to sign your **Exit Criteria**. Think of this as your financial pre-nup with the guru industry.

*A template: "I will quit if I lose $_______" and "I will quit if I make no profit by month _______".*

If you don't set these numbers now, you will keep "investing" until your bank account has a panic attack. Write them down. Sign it. Stick it to your monitor.

Now, let’s look at your **Advantage Assessment**.

- **Time Check:** Do you actually have 47 hours a week to talk to Mike the Plumber?
- **Cash Check:** Do you have $12,400 to lose while you wait for your first "recurring" dollar?

If you have more time than money, stop buying software. Put on a polo shirt and start walking into businesses. That’s how Tyler did it.

If you have more money than time, stop doing the DMs yourself. Hire a pro.

And if you have neither? Go back to Chapter 7. Seriously. There is no shame in a McFlurry.

We’ve shown you the math. We’ve shown you the bodies in the trenches. The choice is yours.

Protect your downside. Set your exit. And for God’s sake, don't buy any more courses.
