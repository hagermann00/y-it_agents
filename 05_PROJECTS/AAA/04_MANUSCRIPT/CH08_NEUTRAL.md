## Strategic Framework for Implementation

For individuals proceeding with the AAA model (3 YES scores on the Gauntlet), a rigorous implementation framework is required to mitigate common failure points.

## Advantage Assessment Tool

Before deployment, a quantitative assessment of "Unfair Advantages" is conducted across six dimensions:

1. **Capital Reserves:** $12,400+ available for 9 months of operation.
2. **Time Capacity:** 47 hours per week sustainable for 12 months.
3. **Specific Skills:** Sales, copywriting, or technical development.
4. **Existing Network:** Size and quality of current business contacts.
5. **Risk Tolerance:** Ability to lose 100% of invested capital without lifestyle impact.
6. **Support System:** Personal and financial stability.

## Exit Criteria (Safety Protocol)

The "Exit Ramp" protocol requires pre-defining termination triggers to prevent "Sunk Cost" spirals:

- **Financial Ceiling:** Quit if cumulative losses exceed $_______.
- **Time Ceiling:** Quit if no net profit is achieved by month _______.
- **Performance Floor:** Quit if lead generation conversion remains below ____% for 3 consecutive months.

## Resource Routing

- **If Capital > Time:** Focus on hiring sales professionals and purchasing high-tier leads.
- **If Time > Capital:** Focus on physical walk-ins and manual SEO/Local lead gen.
- **If Skills > Both:** Focus on high-end Custom Development for single-client retainers.
