# CHAPTER 1: THE AI GOLD RUSH (OR: HOW TO SELL A $3,000 CHATBOT TO A PLUMBER)

Welcome to the frontier.

It’s 2026, and the smell of opportunity is thick in the air—right next to the smell of desperate small business owners trying to figure out why their Yelp reviews are all two stars.

You’ve seen the videos. You’ve heard the promises. The "AI Automation Agency" (AAA). It’s the new high-ground of the digital economy. It’s the business model that finally realizes the dream of "doing nothing and getting paid for it."

According to the high-energy gentlemen on YouTube, you don’t need to know how to code. Coding is for the people who built the tools you’re about to profit from. All you need is an internet connection and the audacity to charge a local dentist $3,000 a month for a chatbot that occasionally hallucinates about root canals.

The math is simple. Actually, it’s not even math; it’s magic.

The gurus tell us the profit margins are 98%. Why? Because the AI does the work. While you’re sleeping, or at the beach, or filming your own course about how to build an agency, the bot is qualifying leads and scaling your empire.

Imagine it: $10,000 in just 30 days. It’s the kind of speed that makes the 1849 Gold Rush look like a group of men walking slowly toward a hole in the ground.

The promise is intoxicating. A "scaled agency with minimal overhead." A way to leverage the most powerful technology in human history to make sure local plumbing businesses can reply to a text message at 3:00 AM.

It sounds too good to be true.

Last year, 500,000 people tried it.

This book is about what happened to them.

Welcome to the Body Count.
